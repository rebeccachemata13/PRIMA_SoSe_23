## How to interact:
After clicking "START," you need to move the ball either to the left or to the right in order to hit the tiles along your path. 
Control the ball via Mouse Movement. 
I recommend keeping the left mouse button held down while moving the mouse; otherwise, you might encounter issues with the window size.
